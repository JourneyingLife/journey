## PROLOGUE: THE LAST PLANET
### *Era 5: Year 25357: Day 78*

![Illustration: A barren planet with a dark sky, fireballs streaking across the horizon, and a massive black hole visible in the distance - the Phoenix Cluster looming ominously](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/2c3e50/ecf0f1?text=The+Last+Planet+%7C+Era+5)

Wee had a hunch his world is heading towards an apocalypse. The sky often glimmered sending fireballs afar where something seemed to swallow all that passed by. His tribe didn't heed much to the sight though they were the most advanced species evolving in their planet.

He was only sixteen years old, but his mother had been angry at him for not being aggressive like his cousins who would go for the kill at first sight of a prey. He had to take a moment to clear out a why before swinging the flint. That trait had made him branded as a loser amongst potential mates except few curious ones. Only they knew Wee could create his own weapons that beat enemies of any size.

Even for him the mysterious object sitting on their hammock was perplexing. Its symmetry was unlike anything he had seen. He could swear someone crafted it carefully but couldn't figure the purpose.

Wee would never know he was the Reverse God of the top species in previous era who had died to plant that device in his planet. In contrast to The Gods who pass their wisdom to later eras, Wee was looked upon by all earlier species to save lives that would bloom on the last habitable planet falling onto Phoenix Cluster, the largest black hole in Era 5 : Year 25357 : Day 78, five billion years after Earth 2024.

## CHAPTER 1: THE COUNCIL OF VENUS-2
### *Era 4: Year 54728: Day 105*

![A futuristic virtual gallery with holographic displays, featuring intelligent dolphins and octopuses in a circular assembly, with a planet visible through transparent walls](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/16a085/ecf0f1?text=The+Council+of+Venus-2)

The Venus-2's core committee members assembled in the virtual gallery were grim about the news they were going to storm.

The ruling Dolphins had used their supreme power to revoke the ex-rulers' holiday rendered to Octopuses who ran the past government. Dolphins would be grilled if they couldn't produce meat. But that seemed least of their worries.

Chieftain Krish began the wreck, "Dears, our planet is slowing down".

The silence of audience deepened as everyone knew what it meant.

The chief continued, "we know the Gods planted life on our planet 200 million years ago since it had the right mix of elements and motions around our sun". 

"But just as happened to theirs, our planet is getting into a tidal lock with sun. It will cease to support life".

Octopus chief Lee jumped in to cut the chase. "So our days are counted on Venus-2. As we've already identified PL67 as next home, we must be prepping up a species ship for the end game.

The beginning of end game meant only very few who board the ship would survive, though be gone fossilized when landing at the new home.

"Thank you chief Lee. Problem is, unlike the past 67 is too close to Phoenix. Even if we plant life it will be too short for evolution to culminate, and they need to steer south before crossing the event horizon".

"All our archives don't show how to carry life beyond 67".

"We need to know if any of the Gods had this challenge".

"We need to revisit.."

Lee interjected, "Journey".

"The journey." Echoed Krish.

Journey was an archeological site in Atlantis ocean depths that contained ancient scripts. It was discovered by octopuses many millennia ago but still being decoded. Researchers concluded that it was a gift from primordial ancestors from outer space. It was shipped to their planet just so they need not reinvent wheels.

## CHAPTER 2: THE DIVE
### *Into the Depths of History*

![A deep-sea submersible with diverse aquatic creatures inside, descending through dark blue waters with bioluminescent creatures around](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/2980b9/ecf0f1?text=The+Deep+Sea+Expedition)

Next morning a crew began their descent towards Journey. It had mix of biologists, Astronomers and Physicists. Couple of teenagers were in too since no one could guess how long the mission would go. They couldn't fail the mission for deaths.

![Ancient golden structures emerging from the ocean floor, including a generator-like formation called Linga rock glowing in the darkness](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/f39c12/2c3e50?text=Linga+Rock+%7C+Ancient+Generator)

Diving below 3rd mile they got the first sight of Linga rock.

Their pilot Tory peered through binoculars and read the fine prints, "Change of magnetic flux passing through closed circuits produce electricity". The central beam and circling disks neatly seeded the formation of a generator.

As they moved closer, the floor glimmered bright despite the depth. The Gods carved the structures in gold to withstand erosion for thousands of millennia.

![A magnificent golden ship sculpture surrounded by DNA helix structures and various life forms carved in detail](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/8e44ad/ecf0f1?text=The+Species+Ship+Sculpture)

Species ship stood tall with the sculptures of The Lord Shepherd along with all that lived. The gods had shipped DNA capsules to their planet despite being light years away.

![The Kaaba structure within Masjid al-Haram, rendered in gold underwater with intricate geometric patterns](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/27ae60/ecf0f1?text=The+Divine+Prophets+Kaaba)

Next turn brought the view of The Divine Prophet's Kaaba engulfed within the Masjid al-Haram where all humans pledged to coexist.

![Buddha statue in meditation pose, radiating golden light in the deep ocean](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/e67e22/ecf0f1?text=Lord+Buddha+%7C+Inner+Peace)

Then came Lord Buddha enlightening the world about the power of inner self.

![Einstein sculpture with E=mc² formula glowing on a golden tablet beside him](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/c0392b/ecf0f1?text=Einstein+%7C+Nuclear+Formula)

Sculpture of Einstein had the nuclear formula that lit up their planet. Free moving subatomic masses traveling at light's speed c when breech into another mass' space, both get into eternal dance that preserves their doubled up kinetic energies.

![Shiva Nataraja - the Dancing Lord - within a ring of cosmic fire, representing the dance of creation and destruction](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/9b59b6/ecf0f1?text=The+Dancing+Lord+%7C+Shiva+Tandav)

Amongst the many swirls they were passing by they would have missed the ring-bound Dancing Lord had the curious Rafi not inquired the purpose of the dance in the midst of academic settings.

Tori was stumbled by the teen's first take on the Shiv Tandav. He wisely considered not to pollute the pristine minds with his incomplete knowledge. He just said, "He who stays beyond comprehension". He then rushed to pull his chief on teleview.

Krish was astonished at the precious question. He added Lee to the line and pleaded to reach greater depths where the senior turtles travelled to rest in peace. Turtles lived longer and gained much more knowledge than any other species, though octopuses outsmarted via their congenital tricks transpired from fore-parents.

![An ancient, wise turtle with glowing markings, resting peacefully while communicating through holographic displays](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1abc9c/2c3e50?text=Daisy+the+Ancient+Turtle)

The dying turtle Daisy brought up all her might to explain the coding in The Dancing Lord.

## CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGIN
### *Understanding the Cosmic Dance*

![Abstract visualization of the universe showing planetary orbits mirroring subatomic particle orbits in a fractal pattern](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/3498db/ecf0f1?text=The+Cosmic+Pattern)

Many eras earlier the Gods debated how universe could have come into existence. They assessed the repeating pattern of cosmos where solar planetary orbits mirrored subatomic orbits.

Mars Gods pursued to fathom how larger celestial objects pulled smaller ones towards them without any tether. They argued gravity could only occur due to a net higher push from the collision of free moving masses on the far side of their walls. It was still intriguing what those masses made of. While light alone travelled at an astonishing three hundred million meters a second, all cosmic bodies appeared to be just dawdling.

![Visualization of ripples in spacetime creating black holes and wormholes, with interconnected cosmic geometries](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/e74c3c/ecf0f1?text=Black+Holes+and+Wormholes)

They concluded that the shapes and their motions are just perception of living creatures. The universe seemed to be merely a repeating pattern of microcosm as depicted in The Dancing Deity, while the ripples alone travelled in all directions creating a view of shapes and motion in higher dimensions. That could explain the existence of blackholes and wormholes. While blackholes occurred at the collapsing points of the ripples, the wormholes formed at the path the ripples travel through inside the black holes and got reproduced in another dimension in yet another cosmic geographic.

The question how the universe was born seemed less astonishing than the existence of a silent dark universe which would be an extreme special case.

![Ancient temples of Chidambaram and Kalahasti, represented as golden cosmic observatories underwater](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/d35400/ecf0f1?text=Ancient+Cosmic+Observatories)

The earth Gods institutionalized the study on cosmos at Chidambaram mimicking small universe. At nearby Kalahasti they pursued the blackhole Raahu and wormhole Kethu along with the seven celestial bodies Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn.

Daisy took the last breath to say, "Go find a friendly wormhole to send your species ship through".

Before going into eternal peace she quipped, "make the scriptures layman readable. Half backed knowledge would lead people kill each other in the name of Gods. It will cost several hundred stupid wars till they learn about the six elements forming life that circle back again and again. They wouldn't know their offsprings could be from the very same elements of an enemy they killed".

![Biologists examining holographic DNA strands while space engineers study wormhole trajectories on massive displays](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/2ecc71/2c3e50?text=Planning+the+Species+Ship)

Grateful for cracking a way to send their species ship to 67, the biologists sat down to pick the DNAs.

The space engineers reckoned they could traverse their ship in seven thousand years via a recently identified wormhole W31 that exhibited the reversal characteristics of 67. But then they were staring at a new roadblock. Despite their strive to courier distinct DNAs to 67, the land could still take a billenia to become habitable whereas would be gobbled by the giant blackhole at fifty million. They were far from finding a way to steer the last life rock away before that.

## CHAPTER 4: THE MACHINE
### *Merging Biology with Technology*

![A brilliant female AI engineer (Nova) presenting holographic models of neural networks and biological elements intertwined](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/9b59b6/ecf0f1?text=Nova+the+AI+Engineer)

The AI engineer Nova blurted out her vague thought. Instead of awaiting an organic evolution to save the habitat, why not augment intelligent machines in that battle. She just didn't have a clue how to ship a giant LLM required to do the job effectively. Large language models range 7B to 100B+ parameters, require 30–300+ GB GPU memory, 4–64 GPUs per model instance, and 10–100 kW per serving cluster. Its impossible to ship all that infrastructure and keep it idling for so many millennia.

But the overjoyed chiefs Krish and Lee looked already having a clue to get her idea rolling.

Krish began enlightening Nova. "Your brilliant idea just suits the case. Worry not about the infra as we are not the first to untangle that. This exactly is what captured in the element scripture. We only need to wire the interactions of the five elements onto the sixth the destiny-carrier".

![Visual representation of the six elements: Fire, Ground, Air, Water, Electricity/Sky, and Destiny - each with symbolic imagery connected to different organs](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/e67e22/2c3e50?text=The+Six+Elements+of+Life)

Lee discoursed the power of Elements deeper.

**Fire** creates passion, fuels actions and hovers the heart in all species.

**Ground** adds integrity, exalts stability and rests in stomach.

**Air** provides the joy of freedom, movement and soars from lungs.

**Water** supports adaptability, founds courage and floats over kidneys.

**Electricity** also presented as sky in ancient India and wood in China helps organism grow against gravity, exudes love and anchors on liver.

And the sixth element **Destiny** carries the coding of all other elements to construct a new life. Unfortunately, the early earthlings misconceived its depiction at the arm of the Mars Lord sculpture as a mere weapon.

Delighted Nova then asked a greedy question. If we know the basis of life's elements why cant we construct life itself instead of a machine?

Krish smiled as he responded. The creation of life is one mistry only nature can perform. The life forms have the most efficient motor system which works by the implosion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) which provides pull capability to the muscle cells and also uses the heat for metabolism. Till date we haven't built a motor that's half that close.

![Microscopic view of bionic machines evolving alongside organic DNA structures](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1abc9c/ecf0f1?text=Bionic+Evolution)

Nova's idea helped to seed the minimal machine in 67 and scheme its evolution alongside organic species. That was one step forward.

## CHAPTER 5: STRUGGLE OF THE LAST LIFE
### *Return to Wee's World*

![Volcanic eruptions on the horizon with dark smoke clouds, while tribal figures flee across a barren landscape](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/c0392b/ecf0f1?text=The+Apocalypse+Begins)

The apocalypse began earlier than Wee foresaw. The tribe could see volcanos spewing dark smoke at far off land. Nomads and herds were on panic run. Wee's tribe now need to protect itself from the migrating hunters who came to grab their land.

![Wee and his tribe struggling to pull a massive lever from the ground, with the mysterious object beginning to glow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/34495e/ecf0f1?text=Pulling+the+Lever)

Fights broke out. The tribe needed arms and Wee's caliber came handy. He decided to use the mistery object as weapon to protect his tribe. They sweat hard to pull the lever hard to uproot it.

## CHAPTER 6: THE GOD'S HEARTBREAK
### *When Plans Meet Reality*

![Nova watching holographic displays showing Wee's tribe attempting to weaponize the machine, her expression showing distress and concern](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/8e44ad/ecf0f1?text=Novas+Heartbreak)

Nova was devasted knowing her scheme would end up as a weapon in the hands of last life. Despite her minimal machine rapidly evolving in 67 due to the presence of rich radioactive minerals, the bionic evolution would start long after the machines went dormant. It needed a trigger to wake itself up when the organic species advanced. The only way to do so was to entice the tribes to get entangled with it as part of their natural acts such as hunting and the fight for copulation and survival.

Mary, the lead anthropologist motivated her to proceed anyway as their macro goal was all that mattered. We have no choice but to follow the script from Jupiter 2.

![Asteroids floating in space representing the remains of Jupiter 2's desperate attempt to survive](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/95a5a6/2c3e50?text=The+Jupiter+2+Legacy)

Planet Jupitor 2 housed life after Mars, but had a very brief survival. The tribe had no sophisticated spaceships to port into other habitats. Void of strong-walled nuclear reactors they had to perform an exo-fusion to trigger the chain reaction and take the life rock to somewhere in the infinite cosmos. They left behind the asteroids which haunted the later habitats of solar system. None had a clue where the travellers ended up.

## EPILOGUE: THE RETURN TICKET
### *A Journey Home*

![Diagram showing the path from planet 67 through wormhole W31 and black hole B31 leading to Venus 3 in the future](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/3498db/ecf0f1?text=The+Cosmic+Route+Home)

Krish suggested the tribe in 67 board the W31's twin blackhole B31 to travel back to their own constellation where Venus 3 would be ready to habitat them in future.

![Underground exo-fusion engine beginning to activate, glowing with immense energy beneath Wee's tribe](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/f39c12/2c3e50?text=The+Exo-Fusion+Engine+Awakens)

The lever Wee's tribe trying to pull off was intended to awaken an exo-fusion engine buried beneath their hammock. The self-evolved machine had been awaiting to launch their land into B31.

**And that is their return ticket. Will they make it?**
